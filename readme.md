Github Therapist
================

WIP 

When done, will let you list issues, view individual issues, comment and close them.

Features will be added whenever the lack of them annoys me or you make a pull request.

## Token

The token is stored in ~/.github-therapist

If you haven't made one, Therapist will walk you through making one.

You might have issues if a token has already been made with the fingerprint. In that case you will have to manage your tokens:
