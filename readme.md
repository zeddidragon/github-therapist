#Github Therapist

WIP 

When done, will let you list issues, view individual issues, comment and close them.

Features will be added whenever the lack of them annoys me or you make a pull request.

# Token

The token is stored in ~/.github-therapist

If you already made one, you can find it here:
https://github.com/settings/tokens

If you haven't made one, Therapist will walk you through making one.
